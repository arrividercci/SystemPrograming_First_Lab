The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).

Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1

of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:

Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need
Philosophy
redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.

The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The

The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).

Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.

Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:

Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need
Philosophy
redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.

The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).

Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.

1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need
Philosophy
redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.

of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of

PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re

3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of

careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings

3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”

3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need
Philosophy
redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional

of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:

Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need
Philosophy
redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and

The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and

Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.

Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.

The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The

The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values

and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.

Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.

The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need
Philosophy
redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and

8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The

3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).

Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,

of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need
Philosophy
redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.

Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?

5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?

3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re

3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.

the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).

Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1

of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:

Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need
Philosophy
redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.

The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The

The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).

Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.

Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:

Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need
Philosophy
redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.

The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).

Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1
Philosophical
Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need

redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.
able view?9 “I believe in God”: How is such belief supported? What kind of God? “That painting is beautiful”: What is beauty? “I’m a Gemini”: Are there solid premises for the predictions
of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.

1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
Fairly complete lists may be found in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in the Directory of
American Philosophers. The following is a partial
list: Ethics; The Humanist; International Philosophical Quarterly; The Journal of Aesthetics and
Art Criticism; The Journal of Philosophy; The
Journal of the History of Ideas; The Journal of
the History of Philosophy; The Journal of Symbolic
Logic; The Monist; The Philosophical Forum; The
Philosophical Review; Philosophical Studies in Education; Philosophy and Phenomenological Re
The Meanings
of Philosophy
3. Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at
the world as a whole. Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and
human experience into some kind of consistent
world view. Philosophers wish to see life, not
with the specialized slant of the scientist or the
businessperson or the artist, but with the overall
view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. In
speaking of “speculative philosophy,” which he
distinguishes from “critical philosophy,” C. D.
Broad says, “Its object is to take over the results
of the various sciences, to add to them the results
of the religious and ethical experiences of
mankind, and then to reflect upon the whole.
The hope is that, by this means, we may be able
to reach some general conclusions as to the nature of the universe, and as to our position and
prospects in it.”2
Although there are difficulties and dangers
in setting forth any world view, there also are
dangers in confining attention to fragments of
human experience. Philosophy’s task is to give a
view of the whole, a life and a world view, and
to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with
that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent
whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry—
religious, historical, and scientific—into some
meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
4. Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of
words and concepts. Certainly this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have
sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the
use of language. Some philosophers see this as
the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this
is the only legitimate function of philosophy.
Such persons consider philosophy a specialized
field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field
reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the
twentieth century. It would limit what we call
knowledge to statements about observable facts
and their interrelations—that is, to the business
of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts,
however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up”
many nonscientific assertions, many of them
think that we can have knowledge of ethical
principles and the like, although this knowledge
is also experientially derived. Those who take the
narrower view neglect, when they do not deny,
all generalized world views and life views, as well
as traditional moral philosophy and theology.
From this more narrow point of view, the aim of
philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense
and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in
science and everyday affairs.
5. Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers. Philosophy
presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of
human existence. Some of the philosophical
questions raised in the past have been answered
in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been
answered only tentatively, and many problems
remain unsolved.
What are philosophical questions? The question “Did John Doe make a false statement on
his income tax return?” is merely a question of
fact. But the questions “What is truth?” and
“What is the distinction between right and
wrong?” have philosophical importance.
Most of us stop at times—sometimes because of startling events, often out of simple
curiosity—and think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here?
Why is there anything at all? What is the place of
life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly
or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or
through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan
or purpose or intelligence at the heart of things?
Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I
have a determining or even a partial degree of
control? Why do people struggle and strive for
their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice”
mean, and what are the marks of a good society?
Often men and women have been asked to
sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values
4  Chapter 1
and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and
how can they be attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong,
or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions?
What is beauty? Should religion count in a
person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in
God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?”
Is there any way we can get an answer to these
and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances
that anything is true?
These questions are all philosophical. The
attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has
given rise to theories and systems of thought,
such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic
philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and
process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by
the great philosophers—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza,
Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce,
James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without
these people and their thoughts philosophy
would not have the rich content it has today.
Even though we may be unconscious of the fact,
we are constantly influenced by ideas that have
come down to us in the traditions of society.
We are living in a period that resembles
the late stages of the
Graeco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the
Industrial Revolution, when basic shifts took
place in human thinking, values, and practices.
Changes are occurring that reach to the foundations of human life and society. We now have immense power over nature, including outer space;
we have made giant strides in the areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, and the
social sciences. In this century, especially in the
last few decades, we have seen great advances
in society—men and women live longer, travel
faster, have more comforts and labor-saving devices, and produce more goods in fewer hours
than ever before. The extension of the role of the
computer and the age of automation undoubtedly will eliminate more drudgery and further
increase production and reduce working hours.
Controlling new sources of energy from the
atom, the sun, the tides, and the winds is likely
to change our lives beyond even our wildest
imaginations.
Yet despite our amazing advances, many
thoughtful people are disturbed and anxious.
They are concerned that our physical power, scientific knowledge, and wealth stand in sharp
contrast with the failure of governments and
individuals to come to grips with the pressing intellectual and moral problems of life. Knowledge
seems divorced from values; it is possible to have
great power without insight.
Perhaps the most striking example is to be
found in the onset of a nuclear age, which we
have created through an application of scientific
and technological power. We are unable, however, to solve the question of arms control. Nuclear weapons cannot be realistically used in
the actual fighting of a war; using even one is
likely to lead to an earthly cataclysm. Despite the
appalling dangers of nuclear war, some people
argue that we need to manufacture nuclear
weapons as a means of deterring nuclear aggression by a potential enemy; that is, a nuclear war
cannot be planned with the aim of winning it.
Once again, we are in a paradoxical situation: we
are unable to offer a solution to a problem that
stems from our own ingenuity.
The twentieth century has been characterized by a war of ideas as well as of people, materials, and conflicting national interests. Irreconcilable philosophies compete for allegiance.
Earlier in the century, the difference between life
in the democratic and in the fascist countries was
not a difference in technology, or in science, or
even in general education; it lay in basic ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. In a similar way, communism challenged many of our beliefs and ideals.
Editorials, articles, books, films, and television commentators unite in appealing for a

Why We Need
Philosophy
redirection of our society. They believe that
we are adrift without moral and intellectual leadership. No doubt our period is characterized
by personal and social instability. We are at a
loss to form genuine communities that would
lend satisfaction and hope to their members; we
find commitment to selfishness and competition
rather than to self-interest and cooperation. Our
civilization often has been diagnosed; the diagnosticians are eloquent in their descriptions of
the diseases, but it is a rare individual who proposes a cure; the most the critics can agree on is
that it is time for a change.
Changes in customs and in history usually
begin with people who are convinced of the
worth of some ideal or who are captured by
some vision of a different way of life. Following
the Middle Ages, many people began to conceive of a way of life motivated by a belief that
life on this earth is worthwhile in itself. In the
broadest sense, this belief made possible the Renaissance, the Reformation, and our modern
world with its factories, mass production, money
and banks, rapid transportation, and, more recently, atomic power and exploration of outer
space. All these are calculated to make this world
better and to give us more control over it. But
unless we develop some fairly consistent and
comprehensive view of human nature, the nature of the total order within which we live, and
some reasonable scale of values based on an order beyond mere human desires, such things are
not likely to provide an enduring basis for our
world. Philosophy, in conjunction with other
disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward new desires and aspirations.
In his book The Illusion of Technique,3
William Barrett proposes that today, more than
any other time in history, it is necessary to place
the idea of scientific technique in a new relation
to life. As we have noted, ours is a society more
and more dominated by technique. Barrett is
convinced that modern philosophy must respond to technique and technology, or humanity will permanently lose purpose, direction, and
freedom.
. . . anyone who would argue for freedom today has to concern himself with the nature of
technique—its scope and its limits— . . . The
question of technique is, in itself, an important
one for philosophy—and more important particularly for modern philosophy, which has so
often let matters of technique blind its vision.
More significantly still, the question bears
upon the uncertainties of a whole technological
civilization, which even as it wields its great
technical powers is unsure of their limits or
possible consequences.4
Historically, philosophical concerns have
been treated under
these broad categories:
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We have organized
our text around the basic issues of philosophy;
therefore we will merely glance at the definitions
of the traditional branches, trusting that the
chapters that follow will further develop these
definitions.
In addition to the broad categories mentioned, philosophy also deals with the systematic
body of principles and assumptions underlying a
particular field of experience. For example, there
are philosophies of science, education, art, music, history, law, mathematics, and religion. Any
subject pursued far enough reveals within itself
philosophical problems.
LOGIC
Philosophy endeavors to understand the nature
of correct thinking and to discover what is valid
reasoning. One thread running throughout the
history of philosophy is its appeal to reason, to
argumentation, to logic.
We all use arguments in everyday life to support our opinions and to refute the opinions
of others with whom we disagree. But how do we
distinguish between valid and invalid arguments?
Basically, an argument is simply the reasons
6  Chapter 1
Traditional
Branches
of Philosophy
(called the premises) for or against a position
(called the conclusion). An inference is a
conclusion derived either from general premises
(deduction) or from factual evidence (induction). Deduction and induction are both processes of reasoning that we need to understand if
we are to avoid serious fallacies in our thinking.
They are terms used to describe methods by
which we move from evidence to conclusions
based on the evidence. Deduction is the process
by which we draw a conclusion from one or
more premises. If our inference is correct and
the conclusion does follow, we say that the
deduction is valid. For example, if we say, “All
men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man,” we
may conclude that “Socrates is mortal.”
Here the premises are all the evidence that is
relevant to the soundness of the conclusion.
Induction, on the other hand, is empirical, in
that it deals with matters of fact. It attempts to
draw conclusions concerning all the members of
a class after examining only some of them or
concerning an unexamined member of a class.
The aim is to make statements or propositions
that are true. For example, after examining some
crows, or even a large number of them, is it valid
for us to conclude that all crows are black? May
we conclude that the next crow we see will be
black?
Argumentation and dialectic are indispensable tools of the philosopher. The arguments
must have a sound and reasonable basis. The task
of devising tests to determine which arguments
are valid and which are not belongs to that
branch of philosophy known as logic. Logic is
the systematic study of the rules for the correct
use of these supporting reasons, rules we can use
to distinguish good arguments from bad ones.
Most of the great philosophers from Aristotle
to the present have been convinced that logic
permeates all other branches of philosophy. The
ability to test arguments for logical consistency,
understand the logical consequences of certain
assumptions, and distinguish the kind of evidence a philosopher is using are essential for
“doing” philosophy.
METAPHYSICS
Some of the philosophical outlooks that we
will consider in Part Four will take us into that
branch of philosophy traditionally known as
metaphysics. For Aristotle (See biography and
excerpt, pp. 8–9), the term metaphysics meant
“first philosophy,” discussion of the most universal principles; later the term came to mean
“comprehensive thinking about the nature of
things.”
Metaphysics undoubtedly is the branch of
philosophy that the modern student finds most
difficult to grasp. Metaphysics attempts to offer
a comprehensive view of all that exists. It is concerned with such problems as the relation of
mind to matter, the nature of change, the meaning of “freedom,” the existence of God, and the
belief in personal immortality.
Today philosophers disagree about whether
a world view or a metaphysics is possible. Some
contemporary philosophers, with their emphasis
on sense perception and objective scientific
knowledge, are skeptical about the possibility
of metaphysical knowledge and the meaningfulness of metaphysical questions. There are,
however, many philosophers, ancient and modern, who believe that problems of value and
religion—metaphysical problems—are closely
related to one’s conception of the fundamental nature of the universe. Many of these
philosophers believe there is in humanity something that transcends the empirical order of
nature.
EPISTEMOLOGY
In general, epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and
validity of knowledge. What is the human mind
capable of knowing? From what sources do we
gain our knowledge? Do we have any genuine
knowledge on which we can depend, or must
we be satisfied with opinions and guesses? Are
we limited to knowing the bare facts of sense
The Task of Philosophy  7
experience, or are we able to go beyond what the
senses reveal?
The technical term for the theory of knowledge is epistemology, which comes from the
Greek word episteme, meaning “knowledge.”
There are three central questions in this field:
(1) What are the sources of knowledge? Where
does genuine knowledge come from or how
do we know? This is the question of origins.
(2) What is the nature of knowledge? Is there a
real world outside the mind, and if so can we
know it? This is the question of appearance versus reality. (3) Is our knowledge valid? How do
we distinguish truth from error? This is the question of the tests of truth, of verification.5
Traditionally, most of those who have offered answers to these questions can be placed in
one of two schools of thought—rationalism or
empiricism. The rationalists hold that human
reason alone can discover the basic principles
of the universe. The empiricists claim that all
knowledge is ultimately derived from sense experience and, thus, that our knowledge is limited to
what can be experienced. It should be clear that
there is a necessary relation between metaphysics
and epistemology. Our conception of reality
depends on our understanding of what can be
known. Conversely, our theory of knowledge
depends on our understanding of ourselves in relation to the whole of reality.
8  Chapter 1
Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a philosopher, scientist, and
educator. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential thinkers in Western civilization. He was born in Stagira
in Northern Greece and at age eighteen years entered Plato’s
Academy, where he remained for nearly two decades until the
death of Plato. For a time he traveled, and for four years he
was the tutor of the prince Alexander, who later became “The
Great.” About 334 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Athens and
founded his own school, the Lyceum. He summarized and
developed the knowledge of his day and enriched it by his own
investigations and critical thinking.
Aristotle was interested in medicine and zoology among
many other things, and set up laboratories and museums. At one
time his royal patrons are said to have placed at his disposal onethousand men throughout Greece and Asia who collected and
reported details concerning the life conditions and habits of living things. He also collected constitutions and documents concerning the political arrangements of many states.
His writings show an interest in all areas of knowledge including science (nature), society and the state, literature and the
arts, and the life of man. His logic (Organon) developed deductive, or syllogistic, logic; his ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) was the
first systematic treatise in the field and is still read.
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the
good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things
aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are
activities, others are products apart from the activities which
produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions,
it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.
Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity—as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall
under yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are
to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is the sake of
the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference
whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the
sciences just mentioned.

Random House, 1941).
Excerpt from Aristotle:
Nicomachean Ethics,
Book I (1094)
VALUE THEORY
Value theory is the branch of philosophy that
studies values. It can be subdivided into ethics,
aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
In broad terms ethics concerns itself with
the question of morality. What is right and what
is wrong in human relations? Within morality
and ethics there are three major areas: descriptive
ethics, normative ethics, and metaethics. Descriptive ethics seeks to identify moral experience
in a descriptive way. We seek to identify, within
the range of human conduct, the motives, desires, and intentions as well as overt acts themselves. We consider the conduct of individuals,
or personal morality; the conduct of groups, or
social morality; and the culture patterns of national and racial groups. Descriptive ethics is in
part an attempt to distinguish what is from what
ought to be.
A second level of inquiry is normative ethics
(what ought to be). Here philosophers try to
work out acceptable judgments regarding what
ought to be in choice and value. “We ought to
keep our promises” and “you ought to be honorable” are examples of normative judgments—
of the moral ought, the subject matter of ethics.
From the time of the early Greeks, philosophers
have formulated principles of explanation to examine why people act the way they do, and what
The Task of Philosophy  9
the principles are by which people ought to live;
statements of these principles are called ethical
theories.6
Third, there is the area of critical or
metaethics. Here interest is centered on the
analysis and meaning of the terms and language
used in ethical discourse and the kind of reasoning used to justify ethical statements. Metaethics
does not propound any moral principle or goal
(except by implication), but rather consists entirely of philosophical analysis. What is the
meaning of “good?” and Can ethical judgments
be justified? are typical problems for metaethics.
Philip Wheelwright has written a clear and
precise definition of ethics: “Ethics may be defined as that branch of philosophy which is the
systematic study of reflective choice, of the standards of right and wrong by which it is to be
guided, and of the goods toward which it may
ultimately be directed.”7
Broadly speaking, aesthetics concerns the
theory of art and beauty. Questions of art and
beauty are considered to be part of the realm
of values because many philosophical problems
in aesthetics involve critical judgments. There
are wide differences of opinion as to what objects call forth the aesthetic response, and what
beauty really is. Our concepts of beauty may differ not because of the nature of beauty itself, but
because of varying degrees of preparation in discerning beauty. Therefore, if we cannot perceive
beauty in objects that others find beautiful, it
may be wise to withhold judgment until we are
capable ourselves of making a competent analysis of the aesthetic experience.
Social and political philosophy investigates
value judgments concerning society, the state,
and the individual’s relation to these institutions.
The following questions reflect the concerns of
social and political philosophy: Why should individuals live in society? What social ideals of liberty, rights, justice, equality and responsibility
are desirable? Why should anyone obey any
government? Why should some individuals or
groups have political power over others? What
criteria are to be used in determining who
should have political power? What criteria are to
be used in determining the scope of political
power, and what rights or freedoms should be
immune from political or legal control? To what
positive goals should political power be directed,
and what are the criteria for determining this?
Conflicting answers and applications of these
philosophical questions permeate human history; the values and moral convictions of human
beings are reflected in our daily social and political life.
Because philosophy begins with wondering,
questioning, and reflecting about our fundamental assumptions,
we need to consider
how it proceeds to answer questions. Philosophical problems cannot be resolved by appealing
exclusively to the facts: how then does philosophy solve the problems it raises? What method
does philosophy employ?
We have defined philosophy as a process of
reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply
held beliefs. To achieve that end, we believe that
the basic method of philosophical inquiry is
dialectical.
Philosophy proceeds through the dialectic
of argument. The term dialectic refers to a
process of thinking that originated with the
philosopher Socrates. In Plato’s dialogues,
Socrates (See biography and excerpt from
Plato’s writings, pp. 12 and 13) is the main character—the protagonist. Socrates employs the
method of dialectic; he engages in argumentation, in a relentless analysis of any and every subject. Socrates was convinced that the surest way
to attain reliable knowledge was through the
practice of disciplined conversation, with the investigator acting as an intellectual midwife; we
call the method he used dialectic. This is a deceptively simple technique. It always begins with
a discussion of the most commonly accepted
aspects of any problem. The dialectical process is
a dialogue between opposing positions. Socrates, and many later philosophers,8 believed that
10  Chapter 1

Methodology—
Socratic
Dialectic

through the process of this dialogue, in which
each participant in the conversation was forced
to clarify her or his ideas, the final outcome of
the conversation would be a clear statement of
what was meant. What is important is that the
dialectic is the development of thought through an
interplay of ideas.
Dialectical thinking, and consequently dialectic as a method, attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of different positions are drawn out and
interact with each other. As the argument unfolds, we find that neither position represents
a complete understanding of the truth; new
considerations and alternatives emerge. At each
stage of the dialectic we gain a deeper insight
into the original problem, and by so doing perhaps come closer to the truth.
When entering a course of study, a student is
generally prepared to memorize facts, learn formulas, or master a set of material; philosophy
demands something quite different. By using the
dialectical method, we come closer to the truth
but often, in fact frequently, the original philosophical problem remains unsolved. There are
always more questions to be asked, more arguments to be challenged. The student of philosophy, however, must not despair. With this
method we can arrive at tentative answers; some
answers will appear to be more philosophically
satisfactory than others, some we will abandon
altogether.
In Socratic fashion, philosophy proceeds by
attempting to correct incomplete or inaccurate
notions, by “coaxing” the truth out of the situation. Socrates is famous for his belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Similarly, philosophy proceeds with the conviction that the
unexamined idea is not worth having. Dialectic
necessarily involves critical reflection.
Before registering for
an introductory philosophy course, students
frequently ask: “Why
study philosophy?” “What use is philosophy?”
“Is philosophy of any value to me personally, and
will it help my career?”
PHILOSOPHY AS INESCAPABLE
Everybody has some notion of reality. Whether
fully examined or not, ideas about the origin,
destiny, and fabric of existence—including views
about God and human nature—have a place in
each person’s mind. Everyone also has some notion of knowledge. Ideas about the authentic
sources of knowledge, about subjective beliefs in
contrast to objective truths, and about methods
that prove a conclusion true or false form a part
of everyday life. We all have some notion of values, including right or wrong. Most of us try to
think correctly and to reason in a valid fashion so
that others will heed us when we set forth our
ideas. Far from being merely a classroom exercise, issues of metaphysics, epistemology, values,
and logic are part of everyday living.
THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY
Shallowness, incompleteness, poor reasoning,
and assertions with flimsy foundations prevent a
truly enlightened citizenry. Persuasive orators
can sway minds and hearts and thereby wage
wars, gain political control, establish cults, and
otherwise seduce an unsuspecting public. Unaware of the complexities of an issue, unfamiliar
with a comprehensive view of a topic, unable to
distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning,
ready to yield to authoritarian approaches, individuals and entire communities have been asked
to sacrifice their lives for certain values and ideals.
However, people who have studied philosophy
are more likely to pursue an issue in depth and to
examine it comprehensively with sound reasoning. Having the courage to question the conventional and traditional is useful for individuals in
achieving intellectual autonomy and in helping
communities to make informed choices.
Failure to obtain a specific answer to a philosophical question or an acceptable solution to a
problematic issue frequently leads to frustration.
The Task of Philosophy  11
The Uses
of Philosophy

Nonetheless, exploration of the possible, reasonable solutions clarifies the options open to
thoughtful persons. The usefulness of choosing
from reasoned, researched alternatives rather
than from bigoted, impulsive, and unclear claims
is apparent in all dimensions of our lives. Ideally,
the study of philosophy nurtures our capacity for
making informed choices.
SPECIFIC PERSONAL USES
Examining our everyday language often leads to
philosophical questions. “I want to do the right
thing” is an expression regularly used by all of us;
ethical reflection can illuminate an individual’s
sense of right. “Wait and see what happens” may
imply philosophical fatalism: Is fatalism a reason12  Chapter 1

Socrates Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) was a Greek philosopher of Athens.
Famous for his view of philosophy as a pursuit necessary to all
intelligent humans, Socrates lived by his principles even though
they ultimately cost him his life. Socrates was widely known
for his intellectual power and use of the dialectical method.
According to Plato’s report of Socrates’ speech in the Apology,
the oracle at Delphi pronounced that there was no one wiser
than Socrates in all of Greece. However, Socrates never himself
claimed to be wise; he always professed ignorance. Thus, he
became convinced that his calling was to search for wisdom
about right conduct by which he might guide the intellectual
and moral development of the Athenians. Neglecting his own
affairs, he spent his time discussing virtue, justice, and piety
wherever his fellow citizens congregated. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates
was brought to trial for corrupting youth and for religious heresies. The trial and death of Socrates are described in the Apology,
the Crito, and the Phaedo of Plato with great dramatic power.

of astrology?
“Developing a philosophy of life” was an
objective considered essential or at least important by about 45 percent of American college
freshmen in 1993.10 More important were, in ascending order, helping others who are in difficulty, becoming an authority in one’s field, raising a family, and being very well-off financially.
We wonder whether the responses were based on
a clear understanding of the nature of values and
the possible meanings of “developing a philosophy of life.” Were the surveyed students aware of
The Task of Philosophy  13
Socrates: . . . Meno, be generous and tell me what you say that
virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been
mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge, although I have just been saying that I have never found
anybody who had.
Meno: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering
your question. Let us first take the virtue of a man—he should
know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it
to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be
careful not to suffer harm himself. . . . Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of
each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice,
Socrates.
Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for
one virtue you present me with a swarm of them, which are in
your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm,
and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer
that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ
as bees because there are many and different kinds of them; or
are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as
for example, beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me?
Meno: I should answer that bees do not differ from one
another, as bees.
Socrates: And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to
know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not
differ, but are all alike. . . .

the meanings, branches, and tools of philosophy? Had they any notion of the benefits of
choosing adequate views of reality and maintaining a coherent, consistent world view? We
propose that a mature person’s philosophic beliefs are well established; such a man or woman
is well integrated, and sustains a harmony between thought and action that is indispensable
to his or her well-being.
As the ancient philosophers long ago discerned, philosophy is a quest for wisdom. We all
are aware that a person can have a great deal of
knowledge and still be a learned fool. In our age
of confusion and uncertainty, we need a sense of
direction. Wisdom is what provides us with that
sense: it is an affair of values. As Abraham Kaplan
has written regarding wisdom:
Whatever else wisdom may be, it is in some
sense an understanding of life. It is not a
purely cerebral attainment; wisdom is as much
a matter of what we do and feel as it is of how
we think. But thought is central to it. . . . Wisdom is a matter of seeing things—but as they
are, not subjectively.11
Wisdom is intelligent conduct of human
affairs. We experience intellectual discomfort
when confronted with fragmentary and confused views of the world. Without some unity of
outlook, the self is divided. Among other benefits, study of philosophy gives our lives an inner
integration, helps us to decide what to approve
and what to disapprove, and provides a sense of
the meaning of human existence.
SPECIFIC VOCATIONAL USES
In recent years, professionals and businesses have
begun to pay attention to the ethical dimensions
of their practices. In business ethics, many of the
following issues are discussed: What is the goal
of a corporation? What are the ethics of “whistleblowing”? What is fair in competition? How can
we resolve conflicts of profit making with the
good of the environment? Ought we to demand
truth telling in advertising? How should we
view job discrimination, affirmative-action hiring practices, respective rights of employers and
employees, social responsibilities of business, responsibilities of business to the consumer, the
role of government in business, and so on?
For those in the health-care professions, the
thorny ethical issues regarding reproductive
technologies, allowing or helping chronically
and terminally ill patients to die with dignity,
suicide, patients’ rights, genetic engineering,
and public health care are in the forefront of
investigations.
Each occupation is in the process of identifying the ethical issues it confronts in practice.
The usefulness of identifying and understanding
the options—a task undertaken by philosophers—is evident. “Applied philosophy” today is
not only a useful part of our lives, it is necessary
to our daily existence.
Elaborating on our
discussion of personal
and vocational uses of
philosophy, we shall
now explore briefly a pertinent philosophical
area, the philosophy of education. Philosophical
thinking about education (indeed, about the
courses for which this textbook is intended) is
linked to our values and to our convictions about
the role of the liberal arts in various curricula.
Do you go to a good college? Is your philosophy course a good one? Is your instructor a good
teacher? Such common questions ask for an evaluation of an institution, a course, and a professional. A rating based on some scale or standard
of values is sought; to answer these questions, an
individual must have some idea of what he or she
values in a college, course, or instructor.
Some students believe that for a college to
qualify as “good” it must be internationally prestigious; apparently they value privately funded
and well-known institutions. By this standard,
neither public nor local colleges can be rated
as “good.”
A philosophy course may be rated “good” if
the instructor demands little work and gives high
grades, if the reading assignments are short and
14  Chapter 1
Values and
Education
entertaining, and if the emphasis is immediate
relevance and obvious utility. A demanding
course with long-range as well as some immediate benefits, dedicated to traditional knowledge,
may be judged a “bad” course.
A teacher may be valued highly because of
personal qualities, such as speaking ability,
warmth, and participation in extracurricular
student activities. Professional standards such as
thoroughness, up-to-date subject knowledge,
and reasonable academic expectations for students may be ignored or entirely overlooked
when those students rate an instructor.
RELEVANCE OF PHILOSOPHY
TO EDUCATION
If we are to give thoughtful answers to evaluative
questions about education, we must acknowledge their dependence on philosophy. Educational value judgments, like all value judgments,
are debatable: Do they express subjective feelings or objective knowledge? On what bases are
particular educational values justified?
Other relevant philosophical considerations
are: (1) What is meant by education? Is it the
learning of skills for a job? Is it the memorization
of data? Is it, as Alfred Whitehead said, a collection of “inert ideas—ideas that are merely received into the mind without being utilised,
tested, or thrown into fresh combinations?”12 Is
it a process of continuous reinterpretation of
one’s individual and social life? (2) What is human nature? Which image reflects accurately the
creature to be educated? How do human beings
learn? What is the mind?13 (3) What is knowledge? What are the sources and nature of knowledge? What methods can we use to distinguish
valid from invalid knowledge?14
Different philosophical outlooks and religious traditions present contrasting explanations
of value, human nature, knowledge, and education.15 For example, the pragmatism of John
Dewey offers a particular interpretation of reality
(including human nature), knowledge, and values with definitive consequences for an approach
to education. A Hindu’s understanding of these
issues would be quite different.
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy
of education. One model of this field focuses on
three issues: (1) basic objectives and specific
goals of education; (2) methods of teaching and
learning; and (3) curricula. To establish a college
requires a philosophy of education, and the answers to a number of basic questions: What are
the basic objectives and specific goals of the
school? What methods of teaching and learning
are consistent with these basic objectives? What
will constitute the curriculum? Various founders
of colleges and universities have different answers to these questions. Throughout the world,
institutions of higher education have different
purposes, teaching and learning methods, and
curricula.
If a college or university system lacks a coherent educational philosophy, the result can be
a series of conflicting objectives and aims, random teaching and learning methods, and unstable, trendy curricula. Similarly, if a local public
school board appoints or elects members with
conflicting philosophies, an incoherent patchwork of aims, methods, and curricula may result.
A DILEMMA: LIBERAL ARTS
OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Many students today, perhaps the majority, believe that the basic objective of all education, especially at the college or university level, is to
provide vocational training; that is, to prepare
students for a job or career. They believe that the
need for occupational skills should be the basis
of a curriculum; methods of teaching and learning should include whatever means are available
to communicate clear-cut vocational information; a diploma or college degree should be an
entry ticket to a good job. One student, studying philosophy because it was required in a vocational program, exclaimed in anguish during a
The Task of Philosophy  15
provocative class session, “You’re messing up my
mind! I didn’t come here to think; I came for an
education.” One wonders whether such a student has connected a view of education with reflected comprehension of human nature, knowledge, and values. Are students to be trained only
in order to get a job? Should worthwhile knowledge be defined only as that which can be used
to earn a living? Is occupational competence the
only valuable purpose of education?
Many believe that if vocational training is the
sole content of education, the graduate enters
the marketplace unprepared. One reason is vocational training can become obsolete very quickly.
New technologies, new products, new management styles, and new industries appear so rapidly
that skills learned today are inadequate only a few
years later. Training of men and women solely
with occupational information often ignores
their need for a better understanding of themselves and the world. An education that has the
humanities at its core provides the student with
permanent knowledge, the ability to think critically, and exposure to powerful minds, inquiring
intellects, and events of human significance.
Whether vocational training takes place alongside such “freeing arts” (the literal meaning of
“liberal arts”), at separate institutions, or in the
marketplace depends on the educational philosophies of individual institutions. Over a decade
ago a national magazine asserted that, in addition to good technical training, new leaders need
to be educated in the humanities.16 They need to
have the kind of understanding of the human
psyche—of the struggle against regressive and irrational forces—that comes from reading great
writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Shakespeare,
and Ibsen who make us see how difficult it is for
human beings to deal with each other.
Some people think that many of our leaders
display a lack of understanding about human nature, that they appropriate simple-minded psychological theories of what motivates people and
tend to believe that everyone is motivated by
the desire for money or to “keep up with the
Joneses.” They seem to lack the qualities gained
from exposure to the liberal arts and social
sciences, qualities that are essential in an effective
leader.
A commission funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation credits the humanities with enabling
men and women to make critical judgments
about ethics and social policy, to understand diverse cultures, and to interpret current events in
light of the past. The thirty-two-member group
described the humanities as integral to elementary and secondary education. They recommended that subjects such as languages, history,
philosophy, and English, which nurture critical
thinking, be taught early in the student’s academic career.17 Consistent with the commission’s
recommendations is the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children. Founded
in 1974, the Institute has been responsible for
the development of curriculum materials and
teaching methods that improve thinking and
problem-solving skills. For similar reasons, the
American Philosophical Association has active
committees concerned with the teaching of philosophy at all levels.
EVALUATING EDUCATION
Any evaluation of a school, a course, or a teacher
depends on the general philosophy of the evaluators, including their position on values, philosophy of education, and commitment to the humanities. Clearly, many educational philosophies
are possible, and evaluators disagree, whether
they are members of an accrediting team or students chatting in a cafeteria. The evaluation of a
college, course, or professor as “good” is a
philosophical judgment that reflects a wide
range of other philosophical convictions. If people have no understanding of logic, ethics, and
metaphysics, their evaluations of philosophies of
education are of questionable worth because a
philosophy of education needs to be grounded
in an articulated philosophy.
The educational philosophy of a university
dedicated to research may differ legitimately
from the aims, methods, and curriculum of a
small teaching college. Both may have value if
16  Chapter 1
their respective philosophies are well implemented. A course or a teacher may be judged
“good” if consistent with the philosophy of
their institution. Frequently, poor evaluations
expressed informally reflect primarily other criteria that are, at best, of secondary significance. To
avoid a course in physics because of its difficulty,
to degrade the University of Leipzig because it is
not well known by the average American student, or to rate Nietzsche poorly as a teacher because he was not entertaining is to render an unreasonable and superficial judgment. Sound
evaluations require thoughtfulness and philosophical awareness.
There are a multitude of problems facing
American education today. Within a democratic
society, how can we harmonize the different traditions out of which American higher education
springs? Where can moral and financial support
be found that will permit American scholarship
to maintain its freedom and standards? How can
a substantial relationship be established between
an increasingly technologically oriented culture
and the institutions and ideals of the humanities?
As we have tried to indicate, these questions
have no easy answers, but we agree with Professor Charles Frankel when he writes:
In the final analysis, however, these are the
problems of teachers and scholars whose
mission is the same as that of scholars anywhere.
That mission is to keep the tradition of disinterested learning alive; to add to the knowledge
possessed by the race; to keep some solid, just,
and circumspect record of the past; and to use
what knowledge, skill, and critical intelligence
exists for the improvement of the human estate.
This is the function of universities wherever
they are permitted to attend to their own
proper business.18
For most of its history,
philosophy has been
concerned with the
problems of everyday, human situations; in recent decades, however, many philosophers in the
Western world turned their attention almost exclusively to questions about the nature and role
of philosophy or to a discussion of the terms and
language through which thoughts are expressed.
A knowledge of terms and the structure and uses
of language is important, but we need not substitute the study of instruments—logic, semantics, and linguistic analysis—for the study of
the basic problems—the perennial problems of
philosophy.
Recently, however, a growing number of
philosophers have broadened the scope of their
interests. They are working with hospitals, business and industry to help solve the problems of
health care delivery and corporate communities.
Philosophers are professionals like doctors, lawyers, and tennis players: philosophers get paid for
being specialists in the area of ideas.
Many people today have become dissatisfied
with narrow analytic conceptions of philosophy;
in the 1980s, philosophy began to be concerned
with nontraditional fields, such as brain research,
cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; and
with new issues, such as animal rights, defining
life and death, establishing the nature and role of
technology in modern thought, and experimentation with human subjects; and with raising
philosophical questions in relation to outer
space, gender issues, literature, sports, violence,
social norms, and the environment. Moreover,
as is apparent from newsletters of the American
Philosophical Association, many philosophers
are giving attention to other topics such as “The
Black Experience,” “Feminism and Philosophy,”
“Computer Use In Philosophy,” and “Philosophy and Law.” Applied philosophy has captured
the interest of many philosophers who do not
regard linguistic analysis as the sole job of philosophy. In this book, we view philosophy as a
process of reflecting upon and criticizing our
most deeply held beliefs. We hope to show that
the activity of philosophy belongs to all thinking
persons.
The usefulness of philosophy is well attested
to in this excerpt:
The Task of Philosophy  17
Philosophy Today
 
Reflections
 
Far from being an academic luxury, philosophy
should play a central part in any well balanced
college or university curricula. The study of philosophy contributes distinctively and substantially to the development of students’ critical
thinking. It enhances their ability to deal rationally with normative issues. It extends their
understanding of interdisciplinary questions. It
strengthens their grasp of our intellectual history and of our culture in relation to others. It
increases their capacity to articulate and assess
world views. And it improves their skills in writing and speaking. . . .
Philosophical reflection can be brought to
bear on any subject matter whatsoever; every
discipline raises questions which philosophical
investigation can help clarify; and every domain
of human existence confronts us with problems
on which philosophical reflection can shed light.
The study of philosophy can help students in
all the ways this suggests, and the philosophical
techniques they assimilate can help them both in
their other academic work and in their general
problem solving over the years.19

Glossary Terms
AESTHETICS The branch of philosophy concerned
with art and the nature of the work of art.
CONCLUSION A proposition inferred from the
premises of an argument.
DEDUCTION An inference in which the conclusion
follows necessarily from one or more premises. When
the conclusion does so follow, the deduction is said
to be valid.
DIALECTIC As most frequently used by philosophers, the critical analysis of conceptions in order to
determine their meaning, implications, and presuppositions. Also, a method of reasoning used by
Socrates, Hegel, and others in which opposites are
reconciled.
EMPIRICISM (EMPIRICAL) The view that knowledge
comes from experience or through the senses, in opposition to rationalism.
EPISTEMOLOGY Theory of knowledge; the branch of
philosophy which studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
ETHICS The study of moral conduct. The term may
also be applied to the system or the code followed
(such as “Buddhist ethics.”)
INDUCTION Reasoning that attempts to reach a
conclusion concerning all the members of a class after inspection of only some of them. Inductive
knowledge is empirical. The conclusion of an inductive argument, unlike that of a deductive one, is not
logically necessary.
INFERENCE A conclusion derived either from general premises (deduction) or from factual evidence
(induction). Not to be confused with implication;
one proposition is said to imply another when their
relation is such that if the first is true the second
must also be true.
LOGIC The branch of philosophy that deals with the
nature and problems of clear and accurate thinking
and argument.
METAPHYSICS A critical study of the nature of reality. Metaphysics is often divided into ontology and
cosmology.
PREMISE A proposition supporting or helping to
support a conclusion.
RATIONALISM The view that the mind has the power
to know some truths that are logically prior to experience and yet not analytic.

Chapter Review
THE MEANINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Every individual has a philosophy, even though
he or she may not be aware of it.
2. The word philosophy is derived from the Greek
words philia (love) and sophia (wisdom) and
means “the love of wisdom.”
3. One must consider each approach to philosophy
to have a clear understanding of the many
meanings of philosophy and what particular
philosophers say about the nature and function
of philosophy.
WHY WE NEED PHILOSOPHY
1. Humanity has acquired a great new power in
science and technology; numerous techniques
for gaining greater security and comfort have
been developed. At the same time, people feel
insecure and anxious because they are uncertain
about the meaning of life and of which direction
they should take in life.
2. Philosophy, in conjunction with other disciplines, plays a central role in guiding us toward
new desires and aspirations.
TRADITIONAL BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. The text is organized around basic issues of philosophy. The traditional branches of philosophy
are logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and value
theory.
2. Logic is the systematic study of the rules for the
correct use of supporting reasons, rules we can
use to distinguish valid arguments from specious
ones.
3. Metaphysics traditionally has been concerned
with the ultimate nature of things.
4. Epistemology is in general the branch of philosophy that studies the sources, nature, and validity of knowledge.
5. Value theory is concerned with the nature of
values; it can be subdivided into ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy.
6. Ethics is concerned with questions of morality.
Within morality and ethics there are three major
areas: descriptive ethics, normative ethics, and
metaethics.
7. Aesthetics focuses on the theory of art and
beauty.
8. Social and political philosophy investigates value
judgments concerning the individual in society.
PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY—
SOCRATIC DIALECTIC
1. The basic method of philosophical inquiry is dialectical. The dialectic is the development of
thought through an interplay of ideas. Dialectical thinking attempts to develop a sustained pattern of argument in which the implications of
different positions are drawn out and contrasted
with each other.
THE USES OF PHILOSOPHY
1. Philosophy is inescapable; issues of metaphysics,
epistemology, values, and logic are part of
everyday living.
2. The study of philosophy nurtures the capacity
for making informed choices.
3. Specific personal and vocational uses add to the
benefits of philosophical studies.
VALUES AND EDUCATION
1. Philosophy of education is explored briefly as an
elaboration of the discussion of personal and vocational uses of philosophy.
2. To evaluate a college, course, or instructor, we
must determine what we value in these areas.
3. Evaluative issues in education depend on several
philosophical attitudes.
4. The application of general philosophical positions to educational problems is called philosophy of education.
5. A current educational dilemma is whether the
basic objective of all education is to provide vocational training or “permanent education” of
the liberal arts.
PHILOSOPHY TODAY
1. Philosophy has in recent decades been concerned almost exclusively with questions about
the nature and role of philosophy or a discussion of the terms and language through which
thoughts are expressed.
2. Recently a growing number of some philosophers have broadened the scope of their interests. Applied philosophy, concerned with areas
such as brain research, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, definitions of life and death,
the nature and role of technology in modern
thought, gender issues, animal rights, value or
moral problems in medicine and business, and
so on, has captured the interest of many
philosophers.
REFLECTIONS
1. The usefulness of philosophy is well attested to
by its several theoretical and practical applications to human living.
20  Chapter 1
Study Questions and Projects
1. Is there justification for saying that our age is
facing unprecedented problems? Are these problems any different, except in degree and intensity, from the problems of past ages? Which
contemporary conditions or trends do you consider encouraging, and which discouraging?
2. Does each person need a philosophy? Can one
really choose whether he or she is to have a philosophy of life?
3. What justification can you give for saying that
some of the great issues of our time are philosophical problems? In what sense are some of
these issues also timeless?
4. Organize some of your present beliefs and convictions regarding life and the world into a
statement of no more than 2000 words. Keep
a copy of this statement of personal philosophy
and compare it with a similar statement that you
write toward the end of the course.
5. Has your secondary and college education developed in you any set of convictions or values
regarding your personal life, social relationships,
and the world in general? Should education be
concerned with such questions or only with descriptive knowledge in specialized areas?
6. Indicate the extent and areas of your agreement
or disagreement with the following statements:
(a) “There is no more direct way of elevating
our life than by elevating our ideas.”
—Ernest Dimnet
(b) “Make it thy business to know thyself,
which is the most difficult lesson in the
world.”—Cervantes
(c) “Money buys everything except love, personality, freedom, immortality, silence, and
peace.”—Carl Sandburg
(d) “The great sickness of our age is aimlessness, boredom, and lack of meaning
and purpose in living.”—Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth
7. Philosophical journals are an important storehouse of current thinking in the field. Familiarize yourself with as many of them as you can
and see how many of them are in your library.
